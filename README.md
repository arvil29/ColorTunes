# ColorTunes
This web app is a simulated version of a piano keyboard. It basically turns your desktop/laptop keyboard into a piano keyboard, so that
you can play tunes with every press of a key. The app also spurts out a splotch of color every time you press a key, you know, for the 
aesthetics. I used an amazing library called Howler.js for all the funky tunes you guys are hearing, so make sure to check it out if you
guys are looking for something unique! Enjoy!
